sFS - A steganographic filesystem

Create a filesystem within the steganographic space of other files. This is still very much a POC but it is functional. This was just a side project I did based on a concept I thought was cool. Enjoy.

Disclaimer -  The encryption employed in sFS does not currently use authenticated encryption so there is no protection again bit flipping attacks. Also the implemention has not be audited.
